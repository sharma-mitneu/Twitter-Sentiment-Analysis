# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter Sentiement Analysis using Machine Learning Model

This project demonstrates the power of ML in classifying sentiments from tweets, making it an invaluable tool for businesses and researchers alike. Here's a quick rundown of the workflow and some key takeaways:

### üåü Workflow Overview:
1. **Data Collection**: Leveraged Kaggle's dataset with 1.6 million tweets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Converted textual data into numerical data for ML processing.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Divided data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. **Model Training**: Utilized Logistic Regression for classification (positive, neutral, negative).
5. **Prediction**: Applied the trained model to new data for sentiment prediction.

### üìä Technical Highlights:
- **Google Colab**: The entire project was implemented on Google Colab for seamless collaboration and execution.
- **Kaggle Integration**: Directly imported the dataset using Kaggle's API, streamlining the data acquisition process.
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NLTK for natural language processing
  - Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps:
- Downloaded and preprocessed data, including handling missing values and stopwords removal.
- Implemented stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
- Converted tweets to numerical data using TfidfVectorizer.
- Trained the Logistic Regression model and evaluated its performance using accuracy scores.

### üîç Insights:
- **Balanced Data**: Ensured equal distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets through up-sampling/down-sampling techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Focused on avoiding overfitting and underfitting by comparing training and test data accuracies.

### üåê Why It Matters:
This project showcases the simplicity and effectiveness of applying machine learning models to real-world data. By understanding and predicting sentiments, businesses can make data-driven decisions, enhance customer experiences, and stay ahead of market trends.

### üöÄ Key Takeaways:
- **Practical Application**: Demonstrated a hands-on approach to machine learning with real tweet data.
- **Scalability**: The methodology can be scaled and adapted to other text classification problems.
- **Learning and Growth**: Reinforced my understanding of ML workflows and best practices in data preprocessing and model evaluation.
